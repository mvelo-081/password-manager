# password-manager

I have written a python script which mananges your password for several account

this script will manage you passwords safely , because it decrypts them , the stores them.

and the key to decrypts you saved passwords is you pin , which you entered

This scripts gives you three options in which 1) Its generate a secure password for you, then its encrypts its , then stores it in a txt file if you file manager

                                              2) Its give you an option , to manually enters your passwords for you certain account you like , and encrypts them , thn stores then in a txt file

                                              3) gives an option to view you saved password and account names
